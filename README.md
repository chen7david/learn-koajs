# Creating a project

#### PLesson Objectives
In this lesson we will learn how to create a project based on the MVC design patteren.


#### What is MVC
Model–view–controller is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.

The model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern specifies that an application consist of a data model, presentation information, and control information. The pattern requires that each of these be separated into different objects.

#### Folder Structure
Below we have illustrated a tree diagram of our project.

```cmd
/project-folder
├── config
|  └── default.yaml
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── src
   ├── data.js
   ├── index.js
   └── router
      └── index.js

directory: 3 file: 6
```
