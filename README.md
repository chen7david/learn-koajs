#### Lesson Objectives
In this lesson, we will learn how to set up a minimalistic webserver. 
- We will first learn how to setup a node project 
- then we will download the koa package from nmp (node package manager)
- then finally we will use the require function to bring in the koa class, instantiate it and have it listen to a port of our choice.

2. Open the folder wiht VsCode
3. In the top menu-bar of VsCode select view->Terminal to open the conse
4. in the console type: <code>$ npm init -y</code> to create a package.json file that will help you manage your project. 
4. install koa by running: <code>$ npm i koa</code> 
5. create a new file and name it <code>index.js</code> 
6. create a server by writing the followign code in your <code>index.js</code> page.
